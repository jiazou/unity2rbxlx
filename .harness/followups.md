- **[recut docs stale] Update `scene-runtime-pr5-8-recut-plan.md` + `scene-runtime-and-refactor-execution.md`:**
  Slice H's premise ("HudControl `domain="excluded"` → dead HUD; fix the `module_domain.py` rule;
  output LocalScript") is STALE. Empirically (current main, fresh generic SimpleFPS), HudControl
  already classifies `domain="client"`, `script_class="ModuleScript"`, `container="ReplicatedStorage"`,
  `runtime_bearing`, `requireable`, no fail-close. The require-fallback strip + `instance_owner_is_ui`
  strong-client signal already landed. Mark Slice H done; the "LocalScript" requirement is wrong
  (host require()s it as a ModuleScript).

- **[contract_verifier shadow → fail-closed]** The task assumed Slice H "must pass the fail-closed
  contract_verifier," but the verifier runs in SHADOW mode on current main (1 info-level
  consumer_compliance violation: dead water module `Displace`). Flipping it to fail-closed is its
  own decision/PR (likely part of PR6/PR8 territory). Track separately.

- **[possible HUD runtime-binding]** IF the Studio canary shows the HUD is dead at runtime despite
  correct client classification, the real root cause is runtime boot/binding (SceneRuntimeClient
  not constructing the requireable client module, or `self.gameObject` not binding to the HUD
  ScreenGui) — a distinct, smaller fix than the doc's classifier change. Capture with its real
  root cause; do NOT fix blind in this run.

- **[fixture hygiene]** `tests/fixtures/topology/simplefps_minimal.json` encodes HudControl=client
  (now the correct production behavior). Ensure Slice-adjacent tests exercise the real classifier,
  not just assert against this fixture (green-test-for-the-wrong-reason guard).

- **[Pause panel]** `HUD.Pause` not converted (`_pauseMenu()` nil) — UI-conversion completeness,
  pre-existing, out of scope.
